Mass is a measure of the quantity of a substance, while weight is a measure of how a mass acts in a gravitational field. On Earth, where we are exposed to a fairly constant acceleration due to gravity, we don't pay much attention to the difference between the terms. After all, our definitions of mass were pretty much made with Earth gravity in mind, so if you say a weight has a mass of 1 kilogram and a 1 weight of 1 kilogram, you're right. Now, if you take that 1 kg mass to the Moon, it's weight will be less.

So, when the term atomic weight was coined back in 1808, isotopes were unknown and Earth gravity was the norm. The difference between atomic weight and atomic mass became known when F.W. Aston, the inventor of the mass spectrometer (1927) used his new device to study neon. At that time, the atomic weight of neon was believed to be 20.2 amu, yet Aston observed two peaks in the mass spectrum of neon, at relative masses 20.0 amu and 22.0 amu. Aston suggested there two actually two types of neon atoms in his sample: 90% of the atoms having a mass of 20 amu and 10% with a mass of 22 amu. This ratio gave a weighted average mass of 20.2 amu. He called the different forms of the neon atoms ""isotopes."" Frederick Soddy had proposed the term isotopes in 1911 to describe atoms that occupy the same position in the periodic table, yet are different.

Even though ""atomic weight"" is not a good description, the phrase has stuck around for historical reasons. The correct term today is ""relative atomic mass""  the only ""weight"" part of the atomic weight is that it is based on a weighted average of isotope abundanc",investigation_NN is_VBZ now_RB removed_VVN ._SENT I_PP have_VHP defined_VVN the_DT unit_NN as_IN the_DT quantity_NN of_IN ._SENT heat_NN required_VVD to_TO raise_VV unit_NN,mass_NN,"of_IN water_NN through_IN C._NP the_DT air_NN thermometer_NN at_IN C._NP ,_, and_CC so_RB much_JJ confusion_NN has_VHZ al'ison_NN from_IN ambiguity_NN as_RB to_TO","E.
